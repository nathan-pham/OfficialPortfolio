        <h1 className="title-font big">Hey, üëã I'm Nathan. </h1>
        <p>I'm a student at Del Oro High School, where I've had the honor of learning under some of the world's best teachers (my unbiased opinion of course). </p>
        <p>
          <s>A large majority of my time is spent on side projects, scrolling through cat videos, and snacking on tamales.</s> I am committed towards making my community more just, safe, and environmetally clean by pursuing opportunities in leadership. Along my journey, I've gained valuable experience in advocacy and government.
        </p>
        <p> As a self taught programmer, I often analyze and address issues in my community through technology. For example, I created a website called Neuromates to help dementia patients greatly impacted by the pandemic understand neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am pursuing summer programs to help further my growth in STEM and research. If you'd like to chat about future adventures and projects, consider contacting me at <a className="link" href="mailto:nathanpham.me@gmail.com">nathanpham.me@gmail.com</a>.</p>
